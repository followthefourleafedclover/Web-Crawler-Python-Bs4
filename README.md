# WebCrawler
A simple WebCrawler that returns title, keywords, and exports data as JSON 

*Args
- target: url of the site[s] you want to crawl. For crawling more than one site, targets must be seperated by ,'s. 
- depth: this is the time complexity. i.e deeper the depth, more webpages the program crawls, and the greater time it takes. ( O(n^2) ).

*Out
- All data is exported to WebCrawler.json
